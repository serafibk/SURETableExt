# Usage
First, start the server getJson.js by running node getJson.js in your terminal.

In the .html file, click the top left corner of each cell and drag to the bottom right corner and then when you release the mouse the rectangle will appear.
Press Z to undo the last rectangle, but this only works for the last thing you drew it will not undo multiple rectangles. Press Enter when you're done drawing rectangles,
then press Get Coordinates to send to the server. This should create a json file called coords.json in the directory of the server.
